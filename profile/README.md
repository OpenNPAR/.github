# OpenNPAR

### Open Non-Photorealistic Animation & Rendering

**OpenNPAR** is an open-source initiative dedicated to the "archaeology," preservation, and modern implementation of Non-Photorealistic Rendering (NPR) algorithms.

---

### Historical Context & Disclaimer

> **Note:** This organization is a **spiritual successor** to the original "OpenNPAR" system proposed by Halper et al. in 2003.

While we are inspired by their vision of a unified system for NPR, this project is **not officially affiliated** with the original authors or the original 2003 working group. We have adopted the name to honor the legacy of the field and to fulfill the promise of an open, accessible ecosystem for expressive rendering.

### The Stack

Implementations in this organization focus on modern accessibility while preserving the original algorithms. You can expect to find:
* **Languages:** C++, Python, GDScript, GLSL/HLSL, WGSL
* **Engines/Frameworks:** Godot Engine, OpenGL, Vulkan, WebGPU
* **Docs:** Detailed breakdowns of *how* the algorithms work, not just the code.
